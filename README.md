## üí¨ How to Get Your Telegram Group Chat ID
To allow the bot to send messages to your Telegram group:
1. Add your bot to the group and promote it to an admin.
2. Use this bot or the method below to get the group chat_id:
   - Send any message in the group.
   - Open this URL in your browser (replace BOT_TOKEN with your bot token):
   ```http request
    https://api.telegram.org/bot<BOT_TOKEN>/getUpdates
    ```
   - Look for the "chat":{"id":-XXXXXXXXX,...} section.
   - Copy the negative number -XXXXXXXXX as your TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID.

‚úÖ The chat ID for groups is always negative. For example: -1001234567890
